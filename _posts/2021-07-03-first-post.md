This is my first "blog" post. I don't intend to use this website frequently for the blog format - it was just a default configuration for a GitHub pages site using Jekyll. On that note, I am using the theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), and my custom domain is hosted through Google Domains. Here's a link to the website repository: [github.com/bdjones13/bdjones13.github.io](https://github.com/bdjones13/bdjones13.github.io).

Although the common mantra is to always have your personal website domain be "just your name" and "always use .com addresses," that is simply not possible with a name as common as mine. You either need to include my middle name, making it painfully long, use a different top level domain (but good luck, most of the good ones are taken too!), or add some personality to it. I chose [benjones-math.com](benjones-math.com) because at least it's memorable.
