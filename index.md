![image-right](/assets/images/RRS-honors-2021.jpg){: width="40%" .align-right } &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an incoming math PhD student at Michigan State University with background experiences in pure math, applied math, and computer science.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked as a GTA math tutor, interned for NOAA through the Virtual Student Federal Service program, interned as a computer scientist for the U.S. Census Bureau, studied abroad at the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics, and worked in IT for most of my undergrad.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the personal side, I am an avid coffee drinker and occaisionally roast my own. I also love to cook and am somewhat new at being a vegetarian, so feel free to send me any recipes!
