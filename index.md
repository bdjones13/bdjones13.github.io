![image-left](/assets/images/ProfileF23.jpeg){: width="20%" .align-right } &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a 5th year math PhD candidate at Michigan State University working with [Guo-Wei Wei](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/weig/) to develop tools in **Computational Topology** for computational biology.

Previously, I earned my MA in math, BS in computer science, and BS in Mathematics at The University of Alabama.

**I am currently on the job market for a postdoc starting Summer/Fall 2026.** Here is [my CV](/assets/files/CV.pdf).


# Research Interests

1. The behavior of **persistent Laplacians** defined **in different contexts**, such as directed flag (clique) complexes<sup><a href="#pdfl">3</a></sup>, the chain complex arrising from Khovanov homology<sup><a href="#khovanov">5</a></sup>, and with **cellular sheaves**.
2. Ways to **efficiently compute** the persistent Laplacian and its eigenvalues. Persistent Laplacian computations are much slower in practice than persistent homology, but there are practical and theoretical ways to mitigate this<sup><a href="#petls">7</a></sup>. 
3. Applying persistent Laplacians and/or **machine learning** to problems in **molecular biology**<sup><a href="#pdfl-ml">4</a>, <a href="#transformer">6</a>, <a href="#alphafold">8</a>, <a href="#opioid">9</a> </sup>.
4. Using persistent homology of **asymmetric/directed networks** (directed flag/clique complexes and Dowker complexes) to study **dynamical systems** arrising from **climate science**<sup><a href="#dowker">10</a></sup>.
