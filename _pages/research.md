# Interests

My current research interests are primarily in developing tools in Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for computational biology. I am working with [Guowei Wei](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/weig/) on a couple of projects to build [Persistent Topological Laplacians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIHirU11jqI), like the one in [this paper](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/weig/paper/p290.pdf) by [Rui Wang](https://wangru25.github.io/).

# Projects

## A Persistent Topological Laplacian for Directed Flag Complexes

By combining persistent topological Laplacians with the directed flag complex (aka directed clique complex), we can glean information about the persistent homology and more. This builds on the fast persistent homology tool, Flagser, which was build similarly to Ripser: [Computing Persistent Homology of Directed Flag Complexes](https://doi.org/10.3390/a13010019) by Daniel LÃ¼tgehetmann et al., 2020.

The paper on this work will hopefully be ready to submit in the next week or so! Stay tuned. Here is a picture of a small filtered complex using a triangle, and it's "spectra" (which report the persistent Betti number plus more):

## Adaptive pseudo-time methods for solving the Nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann Equation

This project is the basis for [this paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.4310/CIS.2021.v21.n1.a5), Ullah et al., 2023, and my master's thesis. This work was completed with [Shan Zhao's](http://szhao.people.ua.edu/) research group at the [University of Alabama](http://www.math.ua.edu/).
