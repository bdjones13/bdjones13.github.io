# Interests

My current research interests are primarily in computational mathematical biology.

I am also interested in many other topics, such as number theory, cryptography, cyber security, and machine learning. 

# Projects

## Adaptive pseudo-time methods for solving the Nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann Equation

This project is the basis for my first publication and my master's thesis. This work was completed with [Shan Zhao's](http://szhao.people.ua.edu/) research group at the [University of Alabama](http://www.math.ua.edu/).
