# Grad school

* Matt Might's <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/">blog</a> has a lot of advice articles on academia, like  <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/"> The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.</a> and <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-apply-and-get-in-to-graduate-school-in-science-mathematics-engineering-or-computer-science/"> HOWTO: Get into grad school</a>. 

* Peter Feibelman's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465022227"> A PhD Is Not Enough!: A Guide to Survival in Science</a> was formative in me deciding to go to grad school. I recommend it to many people, despite the scary sounding title.

* Emily Roberts's <a href="https://pfforphds.com/">Personal Finance for PhDs</a> is an amazing resource (particularly the podcast) for financial literacy specific to grad students and postdocs, like paying estimated taxes on fellowships and how to invest.
